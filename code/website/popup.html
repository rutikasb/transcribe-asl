        Positioning Instructions:</br>

        1. Ensure you are horizontally centered in the video.</br></br>

2. Sit far enough away from webcam such that there is about 6" of space above
your head and 6" of space below your waist within the frame.</br></br>

3. You donâ€™t have to do anything special regarding clicking the mouse to
start/stop recording, so long as the mouse is at or below the bottom of the
frame. The algorithm will eliminate the frames where you are reaching for or
pulling away from the mouse.</br></br>
