Hacks to get videojs working in Firefox 60.8.0esrPlatform Tested:Windows 10 (Windows Server 2016 and variants should work also). Linuxes should also work but not tried yet. Requirements:nodejs version: v10.13.0npm version: 6.4.1videojs-record plugin: https://github.com/collab-project/videojs-record. videojs framework: https://videojs.com/The webapp itself is written in basic HTML5 and Javascript, both of which Iam slightly better than a beginner in. Have violated acardinalrulefor 1stcut: Have repeated myself intentionally (can functionize later). You will see this in mids.html. Also, initially Ihad split scripts in multiple js files, but lately, Ijust have everything inline within mids.html. Have leveraged the webserver utilized by videojs(https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)The core of the hacks are in just three files: mids.html, examples.css, dev.jsInstructions to get in working on Windows:1.Install nodejs and npm. Try using Chocolatey for it. 2.clone videojs-record; cd into videojs-record directory and run: “npm install”3.cd build-config/fragments; replace dev.js there-in with the dev.js attached in this document. 4.run: “npm run buildand then “npm run start”. Thelatter will start a listener on port: 8080. editdev.js if you want to use a different port #. npm run start will take some time to run. It is the main engine for videojs-record. 5.Now you should be able to localhost:8080 to checkout the webapp. Note: behavior over the network is different from that of localhost. mids.html: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l-iplHe1Kngg9HQAtriR9uDl7fLea7R-examples.css: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HP_xneyQHXchnQlc8lrbTzBYn3YRh2fSdev.js: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1usP-r7fER6pzXHrpUVpxSBxe2zRinN3G
